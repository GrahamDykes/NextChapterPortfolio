### Projects
I plan on filling out this section with projects from a bootcamp. I plan on having a bulleted list of the utilized technologies, so that people scanning my portfolio can QUICKLY find any relevant skills they are looking to hire.

### The webcam

This works! I plan on having it running once I move to a place where I can have a workshop. I do a LOT of raspberry pi /arduino projects, making my own spy gadgets mostly. But i did get it to live stream directly to youtube, and then embed that livestream onto my site.
